      <title>A Data Scientist&#39;s Guide to Modern Java(8&#43;) and the JVM</title>

      <description>Most data scientists avoid the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) like the plague. The features that make developers and data engineers so productive as a team, such as access modifiers and powerful IDEs, feel slow, old, and cumbersome to individuals interacting with data and prototyping new algorithms. However, the JVM and its supporting system matured to an indominatble force since its inception. It is ubiquitous in the most popular open-source projects; espectially in Big Data and distributed systems, such as Hadoop and Kafka.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Groovy for Data Science on the JVM</title>
      <link>https://imtorgdemo.github.io/posts/blog_programming_java-groovy/</link>

      <description>Groovy is a scripting language that compiles to the Java Virtual Machine. It would be more-aptly named JavaScript if that name were not already taken, but it has many similarities to Python. In fact, some of the libraries implemented for Groovy, such as TableSaw, attempt to take it in the same Data Science direction as Python.
This post will provide an introduction to the Groovy language using Jupyter notebook with BeakerX, and provides specific applications to Data Science.</description>

      <description>There is one question on every economist&amp;rsquo;s mind: Where has inflation gone? It is imperative to understanding how actors make decisions and allocate limited resources. The fact that the inflation rate is so low for so long is incredibly disconcerting for many reasons (with the fear of deflation being just one reason).
Because of low growth and a lack of inflation the US government and Federal Reserve, as well as nearly every nations&amp;rsquo; central Bank, are pouring fuel onto the economy and getting a paltry return.</description>

      <title>The Linux Command Line with Fish Shell</title>
      <link>https://imtorgdemo.github.io/posts/blog_cmdln-linux_fish/</link>

      <description>The Linux terminal (typically implemented with the Bourne Again Shell Script, BASH) can be intimidating for beginners and annoying for experienced programmers. But, it is a necessity for most users of Linux; and, in many situations, it can also be a huge productivity enhancer over graphical interfaces.
Fish is a commandline tool that is a great complement to BASH. It is highly configureable and provides nice features such as syntax coloring and TAB command completion, out-of-the-box.</description>

      <title>Simple, Scalable, and Responsive Data Retrieval with ElasticSearch</title>
      <link>https://imtorgdemo.github.io/posts/blog_datastore-elasticsearch/</link>

      <description>Distributed systems are very popular tools in the &amp;lsquo;big data&amp;rsquo; market space and ElasticSearch evolved to become one of the major players. It serves the niche role of scaling to store large amounts of data, then allows querying it quickly. It evolved greatly over the last ten years to provide a variety of functionality. While it serves its primary purpose well, teams should resist the urge to use it in other roles, such as advanced analytics.</description>

      <title>Solving Textual Problems with Regular Expressions</title>
      <link>https://imtorgdemo.github.io/posts/blog_nlp-regular_expressions_workflow/</link>

      <description>Regular Expressions provide an important foundation for learning systems. They are useful for quick and direct approaches to solving problems without creating mounds of training data, nor the infrastructure for deploying a model. While they are a common programming technique, and simple enough to employ, they tend to be used so infrequently that you must re-learn them each time you wish to apply. This post summarizes the basic regex syntax, strategies, and workflow in hopes it will decrease the time needed to implement.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Machine Learning Process</title>
      <link>https://imtorgdemo.github.io/posts/blog_models-machine_learning/</link>

      <guid>https://imtorgdemo.github.io/posts/blog_models-machine_learning/</guid>
      <description>This work describes a general approach to follow when performing machine learning (ML) manually, and when automating in a deployment setting. Unlike a classical statistical analysis, standard machine learning projects typically follow a general and repeatable process. While the practictioner should be aware of details for each of the steps and the reasons for choosing them, there is much less design-thinking and checking of assumptions that are necessary components of more mathematical modeling fields.</description>
