        "content": "\nThe Linux terminal typically implemented with the Bourne Again Shell Script BASH can be intimidating for beginners and annoying for experienced programmers But it is a necessity for most users of Linux and in many situations it can also be a huge productivity enhancer over graphical interfaces Fish is a commandline tool that is a great complement to BASH It is highly configureable and provides nice features such as syntax coloring and TAB command completion out of the box For this tutorial we will use a quick docker set up with the smallest but still capable Linux image bitnami minideb Then we will install fish and try some of the most common Linux commands Fish isn t necessary for most of these bash commands however it can make your life a little easier while flying through various directories working on your next project Two great references that are much more in depth than this tutorial are the following The Art of the Command Line https github com jlevy the art of command line Linux Journey https linuxjourney com Preparation Some terminology to know before working includes https askubuntu com questions 506510 what is the difference between terminal console shell and command line terminal text input output environment console physical terminal older hardware oriented term command line where user enters commands shell command line interpreter The user you will be opening terminal interface and entering the command line through the fish application shell Install docker for your operating system then run Bitnami s minideb mini debian https github com bitnami minideb so that you have a disposable Linux container You can break whatever you want in this container and not worry that you ve hurt your actual operating system To reset it just create a new container python list current images docker images obtain and run minideb container docker run rm it bitnami minideb latest enter container s bash interface application docker exec it cntr minideb bash install and use fish apt get update apt get upgrade apt get install fish fish Before you get started on the basics you might want to install two additioanl applications The nano text editor can be much more intuitive than the more common vim Also the Cheat https github com cheat cheat application can help in your learning Digital Ocean has a tutorial for getting started https www digitalocean com community tutorials how to install and use command line cheat sheets on ubuntu 14 04 python apt get nano apt get install python pip pip install cheat cheat v Later to exit the applications and shut down docker python from fish exit from bash exit continue with docker container later docker stop cntr minideb kill container docker rm cntr minideb Basic File System These basic commands are common to many different shell systems They include commands for working with files and directories as well as some basic programming concepts such as variables that show up throughout working in the terminal Quickstart python directory structure echo HOME mkdir dir cd dir pwd tree display file statistics stat file file file display help man command help command type command whatis command Variables One way that the shell keeps track of all of these settings and details is through an area it maintains called the environment Environmental variables are variables that are defined for the current shell and are inherited and override variables by any child shells or processes Environmental variables are used to pass information into processes that are spawned from the shell Shell variables are variables that are contained exclusively within the shell in which they were set or defined They are often used to keep track of ephemeral data like the current working directory By convention these types of variables are usually defined using all capital letters Environment variables python environment variables printenv print specific variable printenv var set specific variable env VAR1 blahblah command to run command options Shell variables python shell variables set less without functions env VAR1 blahblah command to run command options Typical environment variables python describes the shell SHELL specifies the type of terminal to emulate when running the shell TERM current logged in user USER current working directory PWD previous working directory OLDPWD defines color codes used to add colored output to the ls command LS COLORS path to the current user s mailbox MAIL list of ordered directories that the system will check when looking for commands PATH current language and localization settings LANG current user s home directory HOME previously executed command Common shell variables python list of options that were used when bash was executed BASHOPTS verion BASH VERSION BASH VERSINFO number of columns wide that are being used to draw output COLUMNS stack of directories that are available with the pushd and popd commands DIRSTACK number of lines of command history stored to a file HISTFILESIZE number of lines of command history allowed in memory HISTSIZE The hostname of the computer at this time HOSTNAME internal field separator to separate input on the command line space by default IFS primary command prompt definition PS1 secondary prompts for when a command spans multiple lines PS2 shell options that can be set with the set option SHELLOPTS the UID of the current user UID Test shell variables python define shell var TEST VAR Hello World confirm set grep TEST VAR printenv grep TEST VAR reference echo TEST VAR shell vars are not passed to child processes bash echo TEST VAR Test environment variables python export shell var to the environment export TEST VAR available in child process bash echo TEST VAR exit convert back to shell var export n TEST VAR remove completely unset TEST VAR Typical usage python nano bash profile add export TEST VAR Hello World exit source bash profile instead of restarting the terminal Creation redirection and wildcards These commands are a little more advanced but you see them often in instructions Once you get comfortable using them they become very helpful python new file touch filename overwrites stream filename appends stream filename pipe output of left to input on right stream stream A common usage of the pipe python printenv less Additional operators python takes input from the file on the right instead of the keyboard redirect standard error to the location on the right match any character string that does not include matche any single character not including match any string including recusively Examples of the above commands python list files in that directory and child directories ls etc conf stand output to file stand error to where stand output goes same file ls etc ls results txt 1 Command history and TAB completion The history of your previous commands is key for moving quickly and remembering completed tasks You can move up chronologically in your history by using the UP key You can move in the reverse direction by using the DOWN key This is fairly standard If we wish to return to our prompt we just hit the escape key We can also type in part of a previous command and then press the UP key to search for the latest instances of that specific command Furthermore we can use the ALT UP and ALT DOWN commands to recall the command line arguments only python previous commands history last argument cmd cmd 1 last command File manipulation Download files or get them via http request then familiarize yourself with them python download wget http requests curl concatenate cat word count wc print file head tail System Administration Administration of a Linux server is a huge field External references are provided in various sections to give more detailed explanation Machine configuration These are basic commands to understand your machine and prepare it for use python os version cat etc os release kernel version uname r number of core python c import multiprocessing as mp print mp cpu count make current sudo apt get update sudo apt get upgrade Displaying disk usage To understand the foundations around these commands take a look at the following disk usage https www tecmint com check linux disk usage of files and directories disk space https www tecmint com how to check disk space in linux python du max depth 1 human readable home vagrant sort human numeric sort du d1 h home ubuntu sort h du sh df h df i inodes Describing CPU and memory usage This is another field where you really need to know the internals to understand what you re looking at Get a better understanding of cpu utilization here http www brendangregg com blog 2017 05 09 cpu utilization is wrong html python sudo apt get install linux tools common linux tools generic linux tools 3 13 0 110 perf stat a sleep 10 Notes IPC is 1 0 you are likely memory stalled and software tuning strategies include reducing memory I O and improving CPU caching and memory locality IPC is 1 0 you are likely instruction bound Look for ways to reduce code execution eliminate unnecessary work cache operations etc CPU flame graphs are a great tool for this investigation Installing applications This is a very old field and you will likely encounter many types of applications of varying history and quality Getting to know how to install applications and build packages can give you a greater appreciation before you inevitably do it yourself python pre approved sources to get packages from nano etc apt sources list install package dpkg i some deb package deb remove package dpkg r some deb package deb list packages dpkg l package manager advanced package tool apt install package apt list apt moo Building packages This may include many other commands based upon the language of the application python build tools apt install build essential tar xzvf package tar gz check dependencies configure install copy the correct files to the correct locations on your computer make install uninstall make uninstall instead make deb and install it checkinstall Processes The kernel is the software between applications and hardware It is managing the processes and resources provided to them The Linux kernel is named for Linus Torvalds who first created a replacement for Bell s proprietary Unix kernel He also created git version control system and so his discussions and comments on web boaurds come with a healthy dose of ego python example process sleep 1 run in background sleep 1 jobs all details and non tty ps ps aux refresh 10sec and NIceness priority top htop renice 10 p pid pstree p pgrep process pkill process process filesystem ls proc process state cat proc pid status find from what directory process is run pwdx pid ps ef what processes are listening netstat lntp how long system is running uptime Routing Routing is a HUGE subject but these commands can give you a good support for the first 20 python apt install net tools route n ifconfig apt install iproute2 all interfaces ip link show stats of an interface ip s link show eth0 show ip addresses allocated to interfaces ip address show network manager apt install nm tool Background shells Multiple screens will become much more useful has you become more capable from the commandline There are three main systems take a look at these references for getting a comparison of them tmux vs screen https superuser com questions 236158 tmux vs screen nohup vs screen https stackoverflow com questions 20766300 nohup vs screen which is better for long running process python nohup screen tmux Profiles Once you have commands down you will want to start using the terminal on your host machine and customizing it to get your work down more quickly There are two main files for customizing your system bashrc Save aliases shell settings and functions you commonly use in bashrc and arrange for login shells to source it This will make your setup available in all your shell sessions bash profile Put the settings of environment variables as well as commands that should be executed when you login in bash profile Separate configuration will be needed for shells you launch from graphical environment logins and cron jobs A login shell is a shell session that begins by authenticating the user If you are signing into a terminal session or through SSH and authenticate your shell session will be set as a login shell A session started as a login session will read configuration details from the etc profile file first It will then look for the first login shell configuration file in the user s home directory to get user specific configuration details It reads the first file that it can find out of bash profile bash login and profile and does not read any further files A non login shell is created if you start a new shell session from within your authenticated session like we did by calling the bash command from the terminal You were not asked for your authentication details when you started your child shell A non login shell will read etc bash bashrc and then the user specific bashrc file to build its environment An interactive shell session such as one that begins with ssh is a shell session that is attached to a terminal A non interactive shell session is one is not attached to a terminal session such as a script run from the command line Non interactive shells read the environmental variable called BASH ENV and read the file specified to define the new environment We will usually be setting user specific environmental variables and we usually will want our settings to be available in both login and non login shells This means that the place to define these variables is in the bashrc file If you need to set system wide variables you may want to think about adding them to etc profile etc bash bashrc or etc environment Alias and functions This is another way to customize your system For more detailed explanation try this tutorial https www digitalocean com community tutorials an introduction to useful bash aliases and functions python alias ls ls group directories first color cdls cd ls cddu cd du d1 h sort h du1 du d1 h sort h du2 du d2 h sort h Path Your Path is where the shell looks for commands It is an ordered list so the first application that fits the command is used python export PATH PATH path to dir User Management Access and groups Access can take a while to become comfortable with understanding Stay with it as security and protection is a necessity for every usage

matching text Searching among millions of files for specific text is a very powerful feature Be sure to include this in your daily habits and it will be a live saver for some future endeavor python grep rnw path to somewhere e pattern r or R is recursive n line number w match the whole word i ignore case l lower case L can be added to just give the file name of matching files Along with these exclude include exclude dir flags could be used for efficient searching This will only search through those files which have c or h extensions grep include c h rnw path to somewhere e pattern This will exclude searching all the files ending with o extension grep exclude o rnw path to somewhere e pattern For directories it s possible to exclude a particular directory ies through exclude dir parameter For example this will exclude the dirs dir1 dir2 and all of them matching dst grep exclude dir dir1 dir2 dst rnw path to somewhere e pattern Perform command on multiple files There are two ways you can apply the same command across multiple files The first is a one liner using find with exec The second is using a for loop The examples use the following Clojure compilation on a javascript file java jar compiler jar js filename js js output file newfilename js python find and execute find name js exec java jar compiler jar js js output file new python typical for loop for

        "content": "\nDistributed systems are very popular tools in the big data market space and ElasticSearch evolved to become one of the major players It serves the niche role of scaling to store large amounts of data then allows querying it quickly It evolved greatly over the last ten years to provide a variety of functionality While it serves its primary purpose well teams should resist the urge to use it in other roles such as advanced analytics Tool Characteristics Strengths ElasticSearch is a Java Lucene based tool that queries large unstructured data very quickly It can be deployed using docker and offers just a simple http endpoint for interaction In the realm of big data it provides much the expected functionality Because is distributed it has great ability to scale horizontally The data is also replicated automatically in case of server node failure ElasticSearch can execute complex queries very quickly This is because it indexes all data Part of its speed is that it caches many of the queries used as a filter so it only executes them once This is performed with support for all commonly used data types such as Text structured and unstructured Numbers long integer short byte double float Dates as well as complex types such as arrays objects nested types geo spatial iPV4 and others Additional functionality is provided through a variety of plugins This supports scenarios for great security and analysis Weaknesses Despite these strengths Elasticsearch has drawbacks that are quite similar to other big data tools Particularly it is great with data search and recovery but not for creating and modifying data MongoDb is still popular for unstructured transactional data ElasticSearch is a type of data warehousing paradigm not a database replacement Specifically the Elastic company with its many related products really grew in size when it was applied to logging and log search problems The last decade saw a growing demand for analysts to be able to search the large amounts of metadata created by machines Elastic attempted to make in roads as an analytics and data science platform This is a dangerous road for teams to go down While it can retrieve data specifically in time series scenarios ElasticSearch is an unstructured only tool Data science demands structure in the final stages of modeling The balance of working with structured and unstructured data is handled very well by Apache Spark s RDD s and DataFrames ElasticSearch has no such complimentary models The most sophisticated role it can handel is the analyst answering basic business questions Another difficulty is the major breakages that occur between versions For a fast moving team keeping up to date with the latest ElasticSearch can be a big obstacle Installation ElasticSearch can be quickly deployed on a single node using docker One requirement is the vm max map count kernel setting needs to be set to at least 262144 for production use python get the

        "content": "\nMath is the greatest tool humans have for solving problems However it is incredibly expensive to get the experience of using it in the real world This is magnified by most teachers and many university professors not having any experience applying math anyplace other than academic contexts This post shows the author s trying experiences with learning maths in school as well as the excitement of applying them to solve actual industry problems Introduction Throughout my youth and young adult life I had an antagonistic relationship with math I was interested in it especially the geometric graphical and other visualizeable aspects But I never truely felt that it was practical The problems in exercises often seemed contrived soley to teach some material Teachers rarely had experience with real world problems their focus was employing teaching practices not mathematical practices In fact I saw that most real world problem solving typically in business are initially estimated then refined based on the results How many supplies should you order Make some assumptions and try a conservative amount This is done without much thought of the scientific engeineering process or abstracting problems to their fundamentals The 80 answer is fine get on with more the real work I also had real antipathy for much of the reptitive exercises that seemed to form math teaching If you performed it once and the mechanics are easily referenced then where is the value in performing a hundred times Surely more conceptually difficult and interesting problems can be investigated instead Forming the Problem is the Problem Much of the work I performed in my formative years was managerial and the extent of simple mathematical concepts used was either credits and debits of accounting or the cyclical financial metrics I felt it was rare to come across a novel problem Any problem that wasn t novel could be easily referenced So the more mundane and rote aspects of math I never felt compelled to invest time This all changed when I saw a novel solution to a problem that I didn t know existed As a reconnaissance platoon leader I had to lay out the emplacement positions for a battery missile intercept system This included the radar command vehicle generator and launchers Laying out the posts where the vehicles would emplace was the major bottleneck of the deployment The bottleneck of laying out posts was determining the distances distances among equipement because the most accurate approach was for a soldier to run toward a direction using one of several measured tapes Thousands of soldiers had performed this tasks for decades You simply had to drill yourself and comrades to perform faster than other teams Or was that the answer The problem was that I wanted to do it faster than everyone else thereby winning award promotion etc And therein lies the rub you don t need math if you re simply doing the same thing as was always done before But if you want to do things better if you want to innovate or tackle problems not seen before then you have to be independent You must rely on your mathematical foundations because they are the only skills available for abstracting a problem In this situation the bottleneck was quite obvious But in many circumstances careful investigation must be performed to find root cause In addition there can be many alternative perspectives to view the problem Despite the endemic use of case studies by educational institutions it is difficult to get experience in forming problems and applying various problem solving approaches The end state demands that you strip away the extraneous details and enumerate the fundamental variables useful for modeling the problem The Practical Value of Math Continuing with the previous scenario I remembered the simple rule of angle side angle for congruent triangles Using an M2 Aiming Circle for survey equipment and accounting for the two angles by using the surveyor I only needed the height of the soldier to determine congruency when the soldier had achieved the appropriate distance Rather than spending time unspooling tangled measure tapes the soldier simply ran until I told him to stop The improvement cut time for the entire process by about 60 my team took first place for the exercise out of six teams Most importantly I found the magic that comes with seeing things from a different perspective and boldly trying something new in otherwise mundane problems In this situation it was simple to discover the problem and the geometric solution was available even to elementary students But it is rare to see this process occur in the real world This may be from a lack of intellectul curiosity within individuals Many times organizations have a culture that is hostile to critical thinking Rather they prefer leaders who are men of action and use gut instincts not the thoughtful analysis of an introvert Such institutions are dying quickly Since the 1960s several popular movements occured within industry such as six sigma and the data driven firm With the advent of the Information Revolution barely an industry exists where mathematical concepts do not fundamentally determine how business performs its basic functions This can be seen from the survival curves of insurance default risk in banking optimization in logistics and risk return in finance The Data Multiplier Basic mathematical rules are incredibly useful and they are necessary for ensuring higher level reasoning is performed correctly But a primary component in most discovery or empirical learning situations is data While collecting data was historically important in the progression of math it is the fields of probability and statistics that make data the central focus rather than just part of the solution Probabilty is used when the model is known but the data is not available while in statistics the practicioner has data but desires a useful model These two were quickly combined and became necessary for the advancement of all other sciences in general and were hotly debated from philosophical perspectives such as the idea of hypothesis testing Computers made difficult computation possible first The linear algebra necessary for regression could take Karl Pearson s large warehouses of female employees called computers weeks to complete Thirty years ago these tasks became trivial with the introduction of the personal computer Now with distributed computing large swaths of data can be both collected and computed to allow investigators to search for patterns that previously had rarely been mentioned by researchers The Importance of Analysis Alot of people are interested in math but are discouraged by ideas that seem theoretical or that may be derived through analysis These seem impractical and unuseful for the more general problems that they see everyday To the contrary careful analysis provides some of the most valuable insights to practical problems because of their simplicity and wide ranging importance Take for instance the huge impact Big Data has had on the world The reasoning behind the Hadoop distributed ecosystem was simple if we cannot bring the data to the computations then take the computations to the data But this simple idea could not be accomplished without proper understanding of math at an analytical level Distributed systems make use of the three basic axioms i additive ii multiplicative iii distributive properties of real numbers in order to move map reduce computations to disparate servers then bring them back to the user for the final solution In fact computer scientists took such ideas to their extreme By using propositional logic the basis of mathematics researchers created new systems of programming such as proof logic and lambda calculus These fields directly impact programmers in how they perform their craft and indirectly effect all users of computational systems Resources Do Not Determine Progress With such tremendous advancements in data and machine learning many people may again feel discouraged that maths are impractical Artificial intelligence will solve problems faster than they can be introduced Google Amazon and their ilk have such vast resources that rarely will problems persist long enough for them to become apparent to the individual much less to contribute to a solution This is absolutely not the case As an example I have a friend who worked on Apple car and has continued research in machine vision for different industries He had the opportunity to ride in a Tesla prototype car where the display console showed exactly what the car saw while driving This consisted of a video with outlines defining object silouttes and classification predictions for those objects But what happened when the car drove up the hill to see a giant sky on the road s hoizon The same thing that an amateur s machine learning model would see when it encountered data for the first time total nonsense Despite billions being invested in the field s best and brightest the result was little better than that of a novice There are many problems that remain both untackled and unsolved Conclusion Just a few decades ago it was unncessary to think critically about many problems But with the explosion in data availability most organizations are forced to constantly become more data driven in order to squeeze every penny from margins This can be difficult to see when educational institutions are far removed from industry Young students do not have experience with real world problems Much worse most teachers do not have such experience either This chasim probably existed throughout history But in order for youth to have more buy in to education the disparity between those who do and those of teach must be bridged",

        "content": "\nThis work describes a general approach to follow when performing machine learning ML manually and when automating in a deployment setting Unlike a classical statistical analysis standard machine learning projects typically follow a general and repeatable process While the practictioner should be aware of details for each of the steps and the reasons for choosing them there is much less design thinking and checking of assumptions that are necessary components of more mathematical modeling fields This makes the machine learning process amenable to deployment as a service because automating the re training and prediction of a model with consistent data is straight forward programming Model Theory Most of the design thinking in the ML process is in choosing a variety of models for comparing performance against The following three characteristics succinctly describe a ML model See here ref posts blog page todo md for more explanation 1 Representation structural model characteristics name family interpretability type generative discriminative bias var fixed variable learner 2 Evaluation functions applied to the structure objective cost loss 3 Optimization algorithms necessary to solve for parameters It is also important to understand how the chosen model effects the modeling process assumptions inherent in representation alignment of loss function with project goals sources of bias variance determination of resource constraints enumeration of how over tuning can occur regularization understanding when manual methods are ineffective fiddling of model implementation parameters statement of strong false assumptions can be better than weak true ones because they need more data Note This should be considered carefully with feature engineering and feature selection to ensure the input transformations align with the model The Machine Learning Process The following are the general steps taken in the ML Process They are similar to many other problem solving processes but tailored to ML specifics There are a few steps where care should be taken to ensure the process is reasonable These are more design oriented and some research may be necessary depending on the scenario The practicioner must ensure he is maintaining honesty with the investigation One important check is laying out proper evaluation methods before implementing them This is similar to classical statistics in choosing an accepatable p value before running the model They include selecting evaluation scores and how they should be evaluated Another check is on model resource and time requirements More sophisticated models need more memory to implement and take a longer time to run These are highly dependent on the environment they are deployed to These should be determined with the customer at the beginning To learn more read here ref posts blog page todo md for more The categories to be predicted on and the percent of records used for each in training is a very important subject If your target data is of a much lower percentage amount than the rest needle in haystack imbalanced data problem then it should be addressed before separating training and testing data The most orthodox and direct way to deal with this problem is to simply resample from the target records with replacement for enough times to reach 50 of your data However this is an important area of research and some time should be taken before moving forward in the process For more information on imbalanced data check here ref posts blog page todo md While classical statistics places a strong emphasis on model exploration and ensuring assumptions are met this is less important in ML Instead much more time should be focused on the features used in the model This is mainly in the form of Feature Engineering which can include several different methodologies such as Feature Extraction Feature Selection Dimensionality Reduction and Feature Engineering Read more about this

        "content": "\nStakeholders want to understand what you are selling and how your approach is different However the level of detail they want varies greatly among your different customers A simple whitepaper can be useful enough in most situations But occaisionally a layman will want to know exactly what you are doing and will not be content until you very succinctly explain it to them This post will explain two methods for approaching such obstacles Introduction There are many types of customers and stakeholders that may be encoutered while selling analytics solutions Most non technical stakeholders do not have the time or inclination for the details of analytics They may have a colleague or subject matter expert discuss your approach during initial interactions However some parties have a real desire to understand what you are doing They may also see it as a test of your abilities that you can explain difficult concepts in a way that they can understand In any case their time is limited You will have to make your case clearly and succinctly otherwise they quickly lose patience and you lose your opportunity Two typical failures occur with the too technical and not technical enough approaches Both of these outcomes are due to a lack of preparation In the too technical case the presenter loses perspective of the forest while getting lost in the trees This is common when multi tasking Moments after implementing a difficult programming solution a data scientist is asked to join a call with a customer The scientist has little background on who it is they are engaging and their mind is working at the same level of detail they were just programming a recipe for disaster The scientist gets muddeled in tangents and the customer never gets a straight answer It finally ends long overdue with the customer frustrated and having little interest in future conversations The opposite happens when a seller is caught off guard with some difficult questions Despite the firm s large investment educating the seller with strong fundamentals the seller cannot be an expert The customer asks some technical questions incorrectly or using strange jargon Instead of deferring to an expert the seller presses on but cannot pary the customers inquiries After some stammering the customer feels they ferreted out an imposter Getting their attention again will take time These are painful experiences to undergo With preparation using the methods below the situation will occur much less frequently Methodologies The methodologies are best presented using examples There are many complicated subjects in the analytics field but one of the most common is evaluating a solution Is your solution a good one Is it better than a competitor s solution Why is your method of evaluation correct This is just a taste of the rapid fire inquisition that will take place In this NLP scenario you will need to explain what you are doing and why it makes sense The conclusion of the scenario is that an appropriate balance between precision and recall is necessary for a well performing model It is important to remember that the customer is not your advesary That may be difficult to believe A good basic assumption is that the customer spends the majority of their day looking at powerpoint and has a strong belief that 100 within a green circle is the only correct answer to any question These methods can take considerable time to iterate on the presentation in order to reach the correct balance Golden phrase method The purpose of finding the Golden Phrase is that it instantly makes abstract concepts transparent There are two difficulties discovering a good phrase and ensuring it is universally accepted Discovering a good phrase requires careful thought to create ideas and alot of repitiion trying them with customers It is important not to anchor on your first phrases instead keep brainstorming and allow customers to tell you what is correct by reacting to your words It can be very difficult to view the world from their perspective and to believe you know better than them is the greatest folly After discovering some phrases where customers do have Eureka moments it is important to validate the phrases Not only should the phrase be applicable to different customers within a shared market it should be repeatable with the same customer This is surprisingly difficult In the provided scenario explaining Precision and Recall a data scientist gave the phrase 100 Precision ensures there are no False Positives 100 Recall ensures there are no Misses The customer shouted with joy that he understood completely Alas a week went by and the phrase was used again on the same customer This time the customer was dumbfounded and had lost confidence the team s work Sometimes that is how it goes Example method This straight forward approach explains exactly what you are doing and is made clear by performing each of the steps sequentially just as it is performed The difficutly is that it is just one case so it may not be the correct balance for some audiences This is better used with executives that are content with a cursory understanding of a topic and don t ask too many questions example method nlp example method png Notice the layout is top to bottom left to right in essentially two rows This is important for the sequential steps The green text matches with the first case of naive threshold The blue text matches with the second case of balanced threshold black text is actual text gray text is supporting notes Baby steps method Baby steps are for audiences who really want to understand what you are doing but have little to no technical background While it is thorough you skip the gory details Baby steps provide the essence of what is happening in as simple an explanation as possible but not simpler We perform the process using the following steps We use models to retrieve information within electronic communications A model may produce one of four outcomes There are many methods for evaluating a model s effectiveness Precision Recall is the most effective evaluation for this NLP scenario Precision Recall have important relationships Challenges in improving Precision Recall example method nlp baby steps 1 png example method nlp baby steps 2 png example method nlp baby steps 3 png example method nlp baby steps 4 png example method nlp baby steps 5 png example method nlp baby steps 6 png example method nlp baby steps 7 png Drill down method This method can be really useful for providing the appropriate detail for many different audiences It can be conceived of as an onion Additional layers can be peeled back for greater detail and understanding The drawback is that it is very time consuming to create and also lengthy in presentation example method img PLACEHOLDER png Aspects for Iterative Improvement Some presentations are collected and used in case they are of value But others may be the key for clenching a deal These important jewels need to be continuously polished presented and updated to ensure they are ready for the next deal Is the color schema meaningful and distinctive Does the diagramming tool provide reasonable way to perceive the idea What audience is best least suited for the presentation What supporting notes should we maintain to help explain While using these presentations in practice and with customers be sure to maintain key phrases that either you or the audience says These are triggers that immediately create an ah ha moment Conclusion",

deep learning models Because pairing meta data with more powerful models is sure to allow for an explosion of new applications it is important to understand the developments that allowed for the creation of this technology This post explores the development of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing It also highlights strengths and weaknesses for future application History of Deep Learning This section is a summary of an excellent three part series by Andrey Kurenkov http www andreykurenkov com writing ai a brief history of neural nets and deep learning Perceptron and ArtificialNNs Neuron built by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts Mcculoch Pitts who showed that a neuron model that sums binary inputs and outputs a 1 if the sum exceeds a certain threshold value and otherwise outputs a 0 can model the basic OR AND NOT functions ref http www minicomplexity org pubs 1943 mcculloch pitts bmb pdf A psychologist Rosenblatt conceived of the Perceptron as a simplified mathematical model of how the neurons in our brains operate it takes a set of binary inputs nearby neurons multiplies each input by a continuous valued weight the synapse strength to each nearby neuron and thresholds the sum of these weighted inputs to output a 1 if the sum is big enough and otherwise a 0 in the same way neurons either fire or do not ref http psycnet apa org index cfm fa buy optionToBuy id 1959 09865 001 Hebb put forth the unexpected and hugely influential idea that knowledge and learning occurs in the brain primarily through the formation and change of synapses between neurons concisely stated as Hebb s Rule When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A s efficiency as one of the cells firing B is increased Multiple outputs can be learned by having multiple Perceptrons in a layer such that all these Perceptrons receive the same input and each one is responsible for one output of the function Indeed neural nets or formally Artificial Neural Networks ANNs are nothing more than layers of Perceptrons Only one of the 10 neurons output 1 the highest weighted sum is taken to be the correct output and the rest output 0 Finding the right weights using the derivatives of the training error with respect to each weight is exactly how neural nets are typically trained to this day Minsky and Papert s 1969 analysis of Perceptrons did not merely show the impossibility of computing XOR with a single Perceptron but specifically argued that it had to be done with multiple layers of Perceptrons AI Winter 1 1969 multiple layers are necessary for practical usefulness but no obvious approach for doing this Hidden layer networks The reason hidden layers are good in basic terms is that the hidden layers can find features within the data and allow following layers to operate on those features rather than the noisy and large raw data Similar to Feature Extraction in machine learning How to get weights for these hidden layers Calculus Chain Rule The key realization was that if the neural net neurons were not quite Perceptrons but were made to compute the output with an activation function that was still non linear but also differentiable as with Adaline not only could the derivative be used to adjust the weight to minimize error but the chain rule could also be used to compute the derivative for all the neurons in a prior layer and thus the way to adjust their weights would also be known Assign some error to the Output Layer then some to Hidden Layer before it and Hidden Layer before it backpropagate the error Werbos stated it in his 1974 PHD thesis but did not publish on the application of backprop to neural nets until 1982 Learning internal representations by error propagation https www iro umontreal ca vincentp ift3395 lectures backprop old pdf specifically addressed the problems discussed by Minsky in Perceptrons Multilayer feedforward networks are universal approximators http cognitivemedium com magic paper assets Hornik pdf mathematically proved that multiple layers allow neural nets to theoretically implement any function and certainly XOR Convolutional networks Yann LeCun et al at the AT T Bell Labs demonstrated a very significant real world application of backpropagation in classifying handwritten numbers for USPS in Backpropagation Applied to Handwritten Zip Code Recognition http yann lecun com exdb publis pdf lecun 89e pdf The first hidden layer of the neural net was convolutional instead of each neuron having a different weight for each pixel of the input image 40x60 2400 weights the neurons only have a small set of weights 5x5 25 that were applied a whole bunch of small subsets of the image of the same size a single neuron could learn to detect 45 degree lines on subsets of the image and do that everywhere within it Moreover since the pixel exact locations of such features do not matter the neuron could basically skip neighboring subsets of the image subsampling now known as a type of pooling when applying the weights further reducing the training time The addition of Convolutional and Pooling layers distinguishes CNNs from NNs More developments auto encoders here s another neat thing you can do with neural nets approximate probability distributions Boltzmann Machine formulation leads to a domain independent learning algorithm that modifies the connection strengths between units in such a way that the whole network develops an internal model which captures the underlying structure of its environment Helmholtz Machine have separate sets of weights for inferring hidden variables from visible variables recognition weights and vice versa generative weights allows training to be done faster Skepticism of neural nets since they seemed so intuition based and since computers were still barely able to meet their computational needs AI Winter 2 1990 not enough processing or data resources to produce useful results Recurrent CNN with LSTM ref understanding lstm https colah github io posts 2015 08 Understanding LSTMs To tackle the problem of understanding speech researchers sought to modify neural nets to process input as a stream of input as in speech rather than one batch as with an image All the networks that have been discussed so far have been feedforward networks meaning that the output of neurons in a given layer acts as input to only neurons in a next layer But it does not have to be so there is nothing prohibiting us brave computer scientists from connecting output of the last layer act as an input to the first layer or just connecting the output of a neuron to itself The answer is backpropagation through time Basically the idea is to unroll the recurrent neural network by treating each loop through the neural network as an input to another neural network and looping only a limited number of times But there was a problem Although recurrent networks can outperform static networks they appear more difficult to train optimally Their parameters settle in a suboptimal solution which takes into account short term dependencies but not long term dependencies The core reason that recurrent nets are more exciting than CNN is that they allow us to operate over sequences of vectors Sequences in the input the output or in the most general case both With many layers the CNN calculus based splitting of blame ends up with either huge or tiny numbers and the resulting neural net just does not work very well the vanishing or exploding gradient problem In 1997 LSTM http deeplearning cs cmu edu pdfs Hochreiter97 lstm pdf was developed Some of the units are called Constant Error Carousels CECs Each CEC uses as an activation function f the identity function and has a connection to itself with xed weight of 1 0 Due to f s constant derivative of 1 0 errors backpropagated through a CEC cannot vanish or explode Sec 5 9 but stay as they are unless they ow out of the CEC to other typically adaptive parts of the NN AI Winter 3 1993 SVMs and Random Forests were all the rage RNN was slow and difficult Deep Learning big data parallelism gpu and algorithms In 2004 Canadian Institute for Advanced Research CIFAR decided to rebrand the frowned upon field of neural nets with the moniker Deep Learning In 2006 the paper https www cs toronto edu hinton absps fastnc pdf was released which provided a way to train weights well if the weights are initialized in a clever way rather than randomly The basic idea is to train each layer as a Restricted Boltzmann Machine RBM one by one with unsupervised training which starts off the weights much better than just giving them random values and then finishing with a round of supervised learning just as is normal for neural nets Yoshua Bengio et al followed up on this work in 2007 with Greedy Layer Wise Training of Deep Networks http papers nips cc paper 3048 greedy layer wise training of deep networks pdf in which they present a strong argument that deep machine learning methods that is methods with many processing steps or equivalently with hierarchical feature representations of the data are more efficient for difficult problems than shallow methods which two layer ANNs or support vector machines

these methods on standard speech recognition dataset because ML had already performed so well on MNIST They did this using GPUs over CPUs and the paper Large scale Deep Unsupervised Learning using Graphics Processors http www machinelearning org archive icml2009 papers 218 pdf shows and improvement in training of 70 times faster Andrew Ng s work with Google Brain led an effort to build truly giant neural nets and explore what they could do The work resulted in unsupervised neural net learning of 16 000 CPU cores powering the learning of 1 billion weights Why didn t supervised learning with backpropagation not work well in the past Geoffrey Hinton summarized the findings up to today in these four points Our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small Our computers were millions of times too slow We initialized the weights in a stupid way We used the wrong type of non linearity Additional Improvements Old methods pooling layers convolution layers variations on the input data used with new methods gpu usage for improved computation activation function less intuitive approach such as ReLU can be most useful dropout to prevent overfitting randomly pretend some neurons are not there while training History of NLP ref comparison of NLP frameworks https spacy io usage facts figures ref comparison of NLP with image analysis https thegradient pub nlp imagenet Since introduction of word vectors the standard way of conducting NLP projects has largely remained unchanged word embeddings pretrained on large amounts of unlabeled data via algorithms such as word2vec and GloVe are used to initialize the first layer of a neural network the rest of which is then trained on data of a particular task The downside is that previous knowledge is only used in the first layer It does not acquire meaning from a sequence of words At the core of the recent advances of ULMFiT ELMo and the OpenAI transformer is one key paradigm shift going from just initializing the first layer of our models to pretraining the entire model with hierarchical representations ImageNet for language that is a task that enables models to learn higher level nuances of language similarly to how ImageNet has enabled training of CV models that learn general purpose features of images In 2012 the deep neural network submitted by Alex Krizhevsky Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton performed 41 better than the next model in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge ILSVRC It also enabled transfer learning through re use of weights achieving good performance with as little as one positive example per category Donahue et al 2014 A key property of an ImageNet like dataset is thus to encourage a model to learn features that will likely generalize to new tasks in the problem domain Empirical proof Embeddings from Language Models ELMo https arxiv org abs 1802 05365 Universal Language Model Fine tuning ULMFiT https arxiv org abs 1801 06146 and the OpenAI Transformer https s3 us west 2 amazonaws com openai assets research covers language unsupervised language understanding paper pdf that demonstrate how language modeling can be used for pretraining These models perform 10 20 better than the state of the art on widely studied benchmarks extremely sample efficient with only hundreds of examples It is very likely that in a year s time NLP practitioners will download pretrained language models rather than pretrained word embeddings for use in their own models similarly to how pre trained ImageNet models are the starting point for most CV projects nowadays Open question how to transfer the information from a pre trained language model to a downstream task ELMo use the pre trained language model as a fixed feature extractor and incorporate its representation as features into a randomly initialized model ULMFiT fine tune the entire language model typically done in CV where either the top most or several of the top layers are fine tuned The next months will show the impact of each of the core components of transfer learning for NLP an expressive language model encoder such as a deep BiLSTM or the Transformer the amount and nature of the data used for pretraining and the method used to fine tune the pretrained model Word Embeddings ref Word embeddings http mccormickml com 2019 05 14 BERT word embeddings tutorial ref Word2Vec Tutorial http mccormickml com 2016 04 19 word2vec tutorial the skip gram model ref CBOW and SkipGram Architectures https www quora com What are the continuous bag of words and skip gram architectures CBOW The input to the model could be 2 1 1 2 the preceding and following words of the current word we are at The output of the neural network will be Hence you can think of the task as predicting the word given its context Note that the number of words we use depends on your setting for the window size Skip gram The input to the model is and the output could be 1 2 1 2 So the task here is predicting the context given a word In addition more distant words are given less weight by randomly sampling them When you define the window size parameter you only configure the maximum window size The actual window size is randomly chosen between 1 and max size for each training sample resulting in words with the maximum distance being observed with a probability of 1 c while words directly next to the given word are always observed Application Tensors and matrices ref difference between tensors and matrices https math stackexchange com questions 412423 what are the differences between a matrix and a tensor 412454 the components of a rank 2 tensor can be written in a matrix the tensor is not that matrix because different types of tensors can correspond to the same matrix the differences between those tensor types are uncovered by the basis transformations hence the physicist s definition A tensor is what transforms like a tensor FastText ref FastText https towardsdatascience com fasttext under the hood 11efc57b2b3 Both the continuous bag of words and the Skip gram model update the weights for a context of size between a random uniform distribution between 1 and the value determined by ws i e the window size is stochastic The target vector for the loss function is computed via a normalized sum of all the input vectors The input vectors are the vector representation for the original word and all the n grams of that word The loss is computed which sets the weights for the forward pass which propagate their way all the way back to the vectors for the input layer in the back propagation pass This tuning of the input vector weights that happens during the back propagation pass is what allows us to learn representations that maximize co occurrence similarity The learning

the vocabulary and meta information to tell spaCy which language class to use and how to configure the processing pipeline All models include a meta json that defines the language to initialize the pipeline component names to load as well as general meta information like the model name version license data sources author and accuracy figures if available Model packages include a strings json

of original labels then it will forget them by adjusting too much to the new data label scheme needs to be consistent and not too specific for example CLOTHING is better than ADULT CLOTHING and CHILDRENS CLOTHING You can create those additional examples by running the existing model over data and extracting the entity spans you care about You can then mix those examples in with your existing data and update the model with annotations of all labels If the decision is difficult to make based on the context the model can struggle to learn it The label scheme also needs to be consistent and not too specific You can always add a rule based system later to go from generic to specific Applications Working on customer environment Serialization refers to the process of converting an object in memory to a byte stream that can be stored on disk or sent over a network This SpaCy guide provides the latest recommendations ref https spacy io usage saving loading The DocBin class lets you

        "content": "\nRegular Expressions provide an important foundation for learning systems They are useful for quick and direct approaches to solving problems without creating mounds of training data nor the infrastructure for deploying a model While they are a common programming technique and simple enough to employ they tend to be used so infrequently that you must re learn them each time you wish to apply This post summarizes the basic regex syntax strategies and workflow in hopes it will decrease the time needed to implement A few different languages are used in examples for various scenario Happy re learning Regex Basics Operators Character classes abc 123 d D matches exact character exact digit any digit any non digit s S w W matches white space non white space alphanumeric word non alphanumeric word Boundaries b B start of string end of string word boundary not word boundary Quantifiers x matches zero or multiple x x matches one or multiple x x m n matches x repeat m to n times a 4 represent aaaa x optional matches one or zero x Groups Ranges and Capture xyz x y z equals x or y or z xyz not x or y or z x z matches anyone between x and y x xyz means any character that is not x not any in group x y z xyz xy z capture group capture group and sub group Syntax patterns RegEx libraries typically provide functionality and components using similar patterns such as the following pattern encapsulate the expression that is sought using above syntax mostly language agnostic find apply a pattern directly to text and return nothing or a regex object match apply the pattern to text and return boolean whether a match or exact match exists sub substitute a pattern for a string convenience functionality Common Solution Approaches Example data We will use the following file for example data bash bash ls Data Bloomberg Chat output nb output example chat txt output We will read in and parse each line using a method similar to the following Groovy import java

can include making patterns part of case statements such as is done in groovy and scala and allowing for raw string input such as in groovy and python In addition programmers can make their life easier by creating specific data structures that can hold the output of target matches Language Groovy The following functionality is commonly used with groovy string pattern operator find pattern exact match operator switch case convenience functionality The pattern operator string Groovy import java util regex Pattern def pattern Gg roovy pattern class Pattern output nb output true output

are r Read mode which is used when the file is only being read w Write mode which is used to edit and write new information to the file any existing files with the same name will be erased when this mode is activated a Appending mode which is used to add new data to the end of the file that is new information is automatically amended to the end r Special read and write mode which is used to handle both actions when working with a file By using the with statement you ensure proper handling of the file including closing it when work is completed Groovy python with open Data Bloomberg Chat

their patterns but also because they can be compiled and used over large amounts of data Use raw strings instead of regular Python strings Raw strings begin with r some text and tell Python not to interpret backslashes and special metacharacters in the string This allows you to pass them to the regular expression engine directly An example is using r n w instead of n w Below we use the following methods from the re module re search stop with first match re findall re finditer search over entire string returns a list or iterator of all captured data re compile method to speed up processing on larger data This is especially useful with a big data framework such as Apache Spark re sub find and replace Groovy python import re regexDate re compile r Message s d with open Data

characters RegExp w d constructor notation RegExp test test for a match RegExp exec returns matching results inputStr search find a match inputStr match returns an index of matches inputStr replace substitute a match with a string The flags are either appended after the regular expression in the literal notation or passed into the constructor in the normal notation g allows you to run RegExp exec multiple times to find every match in the input string until the method returns null i makes the pattern case insensitive so that it matches strings of different capitalizations m is necessary if your input string has newline characters n this flag allows the start and end metacharacter and respectively to match at the beginning and end of each line instead of at the beginning and end of the

        "content": "\nGroovy is a scripting language that compiles to the Java Virtual Machine It would be more aptly named JavaScript if that name were not already taken but it has many similarities to Python In fact some of the libraries implemented for Groovy such as TableSaw https jtablesaw github io tablesaw attempt to take it in the same Data Science direction as Python This post will provide an introduction to the Groovy language using Jupyter notebook with BeakerX and provides specific applications to Data Science It begins with a tour of the Groovy language then describes some of the most interesting features that the language provides We give a comparison to Java with some notes for making integration with Java environments easier We finish off with applications and examples in Data Science This notebook takes code and examples from this github repo https github com twosigma beakerx https github com twosigma beakerx Getting Started You can get started with Groovy in a few different ways After installing Groovy the console comes with Groovy distribution is a Java Swing application where we can write and run code interactively groovyconsole Or you can run a script directly groovy your script groovy In this post we will use Jupyter with the BeakerX JVM kernel https github com twosigma beakerx BeakerX provides a variety of languages and support transforming data structures among them This makes it ideal for learning and prototyping You can get started with BeakerX using Docker docker run p 8888 8888 beakerx beakerx Introduction Basic syntax We provide the obligatory hello world example using a simple println statement to print output to the console Groovy class Example static void main String args println Hello World Example main output

java util import java io import java net import groovy lang import groovy util import java math BigInteger import java math BigDecimal output nb output null output Groovy supports all Java types primitive and reference types All primitive types are auto converted to their wrapper types So int a 2 will become Integer a 2 When declaring variables we can do one of the followings Do not use any type that will create a global variable a 2 Use keyword def that will create a local variable def a 2 Use the actual type that will create a local variable of strict type Integer int a 3 When no type is used variables act like they are of type Object so they can be reassigned to different types Groovy a 2 printf s s n a getClass getName a a apple printf s s n a getClass getName a output nb output java lang Integer 2 java lang String apple output output nb output null output Running the code The code outside methods but still in a script is copied to at run to an object method So during runtime everything is inside methods In that sense this feature allows the variables declared in a method to be accessible to other methods Groovy keeps these global variables in a map like object groovy lang Binding When def is used variables act like they are of type Object so they can be reassigned to different types same as when no type is used Groovy should be used after each statement but is not necessary in beakerx cells def is a keyword used in Groovy to define an identifier def c 1 local variable d 2 global variable var with no type are global so they can be accessed across methods output

Script for every program default access specifier is public getters and setters are automatically generated for class members abbreviated commands such as println semicolons and paraentheses are optional dynamic typing with the def var keyword locar var or with no prefix var global var string interpolation GString is performed with operator such as Hello firstName 0 name multi line strings are also allowed implicit truthy if 100 because 100 exists New operators conditional operators safe navigation operator checks for properties such as if company getContact getAddress getCountry Country NEW ZEALAND means If the contact or the address are null the result of the left side will just be null but no exception will be thrown ternary elvis operator def name client getName will assign client getName if it isn t false and the empty string otherwise type operators spaceship delegates to the compareTo method def x 1 2 println x calls Integer compareTo identity is tests object reference equality while checks equality with equals coercion as converts an object from one type to another using asType without assignment compatibility which is different from casting String s 1 1 BigDecimal bd s as BigDecimal println bd class name Using methods a function used in a script will be compiled to a method within an object return keyword is optional method operators method pointer stores a reference to a method in a variable def power Math pow def result power 2 4 call operator an object with a call method can be called directly class A def call println hi def a new A a

        "content": "\nMost data scientists avoid the Java Virtual Machine JVM like the plague The features that make developers and data engineers so productive as a team such as access modifiers and powerful IDEs feel slow old and cumbersome to individuals interacting with data and prototyping new algorithms However the JVM and its supporting system matured to an indominatble force since its inception It is ubiquitous in the most popular open source projects espectially in Big Data and distributed systems such as Hadoop and Kafka The only competitors to Java in this domain are supporting languages that compile to the JVM such as Scala Groovy and Kotlin Because of these factors the JVM culture sets precedence in a manner similar to Linux Data scientists need to understand the perspective of other engineers and the tools they use in order to progress in their careers and knowing Java is the backbone to this Another advantage to knowing java is that it exposes users to many fundamental computer science concepts This guide will provide the basics for getting familiar with Java fast as well as displaying different programming abstractions such as testing team integration and design patterns not readily available to most consulting data scientists It will also provide support for a multitude of JVM languages that while not necessary to know Java will make life much easier Culture and Precendence Because Java is such an old and popular language it has quite alot of culture and history some might say baggage built around it This culture also creates precedence which might not be enforced by a compiler but is so sacrosanct that anyone breaking the rules will quickly become a target Most of this is created around how Java found its niche as a portable language for large organizations of development teams to deliver code For individual programmers much of Java functionality will not seem necessary and even tiresome It grew up before the age serverless technology or microservices But all of that changes once it is used by teams who have to work together and in turn deliver components for a large monolith system Some general knowledge and basic conventions that help beginners modern Java begins with version Java 1 8 but is called Java8 the Java platform includes packages of functions such as java javax org omg and the most fundamental java lang package namespaces are the url of the company backwards such as com firmname classify functions directory structures are implemented from the package name so there can be alot of empty folders depending on how many suffixes you used the directory path is for src the other is for test each Java class must be in an individual file so you may have to have many files open in order to find something dependency management is performed by maven traditional xml based or gradle groovy based Naming conventions Class and Inteface names should be nouns in mixed case such as class ImageSprite Methods should be verbs and Variables should be nouns both in mixed camel case such as getBackground and float myWidth respectivly constants should be all upper case such as static final int MIN WIDTH 4 Basics Configuation and envrironment Proper development in Java demands an Integrated Development Environment IDE JetBrain s Intellij IDEA https www jetbrains com idea is one of the best However some time must be taken to become acquainted with it Gotchas Intellij creates a project folder within its own directory for each project you create You must delete a project in both

default methods in interfaces since Java 10 the word var is used to declare local variables local variables type inference For backward compatibility you can still use var as variable names So var is a reserved word not keyword all keywords are in lower case all keywords are reserved words but all reserved words are not keywords Specifically Java has two reserved words goto and const which are not keywords Reserved words are those that cannot be used as identifiers class names method names varaible names etc For example class public int etc are reserved words Keywords are those words which convey some special meaning to the compiler For example the kewyord break indicates some form of branching class is used to specify a class definition all keywords java all keywords jpg Access

also to be able to define classes or methods that support generics Using TypeVariable If you put variables in angle brackets in the class or method definition it tells Java that uses of those variables refer to types not to values It is conventional to use short names in upper case such as T R input type result type or T1 T2 type1 type2 or E element type Using Generic Types in Existing Classes Find a data structure that accepts Object s ArrayList LinkedList HashMap HashSet Stack Declare the data structure with the type s in angle brackets immediately after type name List String names new ArrayList Map String Person employees new HashMap Insert objects of the appropriate type names add Some String employees put person getEmployeeId person No typecast required on removal String firstName names get 0 Person p1 employees get a1234 diamond operator Autoboxing So you cannot actually store int double and other primitives You cannot declare the List to take primitives e g List int is illegal These data structures can only store wrapper types Integer Double etc BigO for List tbl Java BigO List png Java import java util public class RandomList public static void main

Methods Methods pass by value ref http www javadude com articles passbyvalue htm discussion https stackoverflow com questions 40480 is java pass by reference or pass by value Pass by value The actual parameter or argument expression is fully evaluated and the resulting value is copied into a location being used to hold the formal parameter s value during method function execution That location is typically a chunk of memory on the runtime stack for the application which is how Java handles it but other languages could choose parameter storage differently Pass by reference The formal parameter merely acts as an alias for the actual parameter Anytime the method function uses the formal parameter for reading or writing it is actually using the actual parameter Autoboxing Java import java util

implement multiple interfaces Since Java does not have multiple inheritance using abstract classes prevents your users from using any other class hierarchy In general prefer interfaces when there are no default implementations or state Java collections offer good examples of this Map Set etc Abstract classes have the advantage of allowing better forward compatibility Once clients use an interface you cannot change it if they use an abstract class you can still add behavior without breaking existing code If compatibility is a concern consider using abstract classes Even if you do have default implementations or internal state consider offering an interface and an abstract implementation of it This will assist clients but still allow them greater freedom if desired Interfaces Enforces behavior Like abstract classes guarantees classes have certain methods More flexibility that abstract classes Classes can implement multiple interfaces You cannot directly extend multiple abstract classes New features in Java 8 interfaces Interfaces can have static methods Example shown on upcoming slides in this section Interfaces can have concrete default methods Example and more details in later section on Java 8 interfaces Restriction Even in Java 8 interfaces cannot have mutable modifiable instance variables Java package shape3 beaker Represents the parent of all shapes that have a getArea method This using an interface is the third attempt at a design that will support making a static method to sum the areas of a mixed set of shapes This approach is better than the second approach using an abstract class in two ways because classes can implement more than one interface and because with static methods in interfaces Java enforces that you call them via InterfaceName staticMethodName whereas with static methods in abstract classes it is possible to call them via instanceName staticMethodName which misleads readers of the code into thinking that they are normal instance methods instead of static methods General rule in Java 8 and later use interfaces instead of abstract classes except for the relatively rare case where you need to define instance variables in the abstract class public interface Shape double getArea All real shapes must define a getArea static double sumAreas Shape shapes double sum 0 for Shape s shapes sum sum s getArea return sum

frontend development a more imperative programming approach as compared to the typical declarative methods found in more basic work Introduction Once you understand the basics of browser languages such as HTML CSS and JS then you quickly desire to have more interactive elements The obvious evolution is jQuery as you can directly perform imperative programming to manipulate elements That was a powerful web technology for about a decade and it is still used today But frontend programmers quickly learned that jQuery code became extremely crowded untestable and overly complex There were limits to what could be practically built with jQuery The upper limit was Single Page Applications SPAs SPAs allow for much more dynamic and intuitive interfaces for users However to build and maintain them more powerful technologies needed to perform scoped logic on modular components The first two frameworks to support this were Angular and React Vue came slightly later and was able to capitalize on some of the mistakes learned from the first two This allowed for a powerful system and fast workflow This post will explain how to prototype dynamic user interfaces as well as provide an understanding of more advanced technologies used by frontend programmers Webpack and Modular Programming ref basic concepts https webpack js org concepts ref modules https webpack js org concepts modules ref getting started https webpack js org guides getting started Webpack builds a dependency graph and uses the graph to generate an optimized bundle where scripts will be executed in the correct order In a more opinionated manner it bundles javascript applications that are built using a modular design Modular programming is used so that verification debugging and testing can be performed as an independent and isolated unit They can then be added to other modules using a simple ES2015 import or CommonJs require statement There are a variety of different flavors of JS used for frontend development including Coffescript https coffeescript org overview TypeScript https www typescriptlang org and ESNext Babel https babeljs io These can be compiled into JS then used in browsers Webpack supports modules written in a variety of languages and preprocessors via loaders Loaders describe to webpack how to process non JavaScript modules and include these dependencies into your bundles There are a few concepts to know about how webpack works Entry module to begin dependency graph default src index js Output where to emit bundles default dist main js Loaders default only JavaScript and JSON files allow webpack to process convert other files into valid modules Plugins wider range of tasks like bundle optimization asset management and injection of environment variables Mode set to

        "content": "\nStatic Site Generators are quite popular replacements for traditional server based methods of delivering HTML One of the most popular is Hugo because of its compilation speed Combining Hugo with Jupyter notebooks and other tools can provide for a speedy workflow for pushing your ideas to the web books online or pdf and more This post will discuss why you may want to do this and provides tools for doing it Creating and Sharing Ideas Creating and publishing content is an investment Even poorly created content still takes time to put text to file and file to web I ve seen many people get started with blogging only to quit after getting the site running They refine the site styling to a remarkable degree then the posts end after two weeks Which begs the question why blog A way to to have an online presence or to build a brand Rubbish No one will go to your site because you re nobody And why should they you don t care about them either Funny enough people go to Paul Graham s blog http paulgraham com articles html and I don t think he spent 10 minutes on his CSS Another perspective is that you want to share ideas with yourself and sometimes others The content I create is a knowledge base I ve learned a great deal of things I want to access reference and update those things as I refine skills and knowledge If someone asks me a question and I m feeling selfish with my time then I can point them to a post it is researched organized and documented at times that I was interested in a topic I can t remember everything all of the time Personally I m easily distracted by new ideas Creating content adds a little more time to the current work I m doing but it helps drive new ideas toward longer term interests and goals The ideas are incorporated into a previous world view that is then updated Strategically I can look over this past work and use it in future projects This is not so much to make things easier in the future as it is to see how perspectives change with the addition of new information Better yet prove to yourself that you understand some material You don t know something until you can teach to others or teach it simply to a child something like that This post is about creating this new habit and sticking to it by not wasting your time with the boring stuff An Effective Workflow Process overview I ve tried multiple workflows and the following is by far the fastest and most effective Two key components are Jupyter nobooks and Hugo Static Site Generator SSG The key components are separating your content Jupyter from the delivery Hugo and ensuring you use simple scripts for the plumbing in your workflow Docker Jupyter Markdown Hugo SSG Book online Book pdf github pages Jupyter allows you to succinctly place all of your content together even if it doesn t concern programming That way you can easily move to some new method of dissemination if SSG doesn t serve your purpose If you make programming a topic in your content you are really helping yourself The code and output are maintained together and can easily be update in the future Using simple scripts bash or python files to automate your work ensures that plumbing can be created easily and quickly modified when you improve your process or make major changes to it This might seem like more overhead and it is in the short term But having the ability to direct your content to and reuse it in different sources such as blog post book or a journal format is incredibly powerful Detailed process To go into more detail I start with a docker image with Jupyter installed The docker container shares volumes with the local space for saving ipynb files These are maintained in a github repo so all content is secure and easily reproducible The only concern is where to keep your accompanying data which is mostly dependent on size An AWS S3 bucket is usually a safe bet Once the content is ready it can be prepared for dissemination using a simple script Jupyter notebook files ipynb are json These should be converted to markdown md and placed with dependencies images media etc into the appropriate Hugo directory structure A final review can be performed by running Hugo locally Changes can be made to the markdown files the Hugo public directory converted HTML SSG files is commited and pushed to github repo for publication on github pages All of this can be done in less than 30 seconds There are some similar but less flexible workflows If you are using RStudio https www rstudio com and are only concerned with data science content using R or Python then you can use blogdown https bookdown org yihui blogdown This is a great workflow and really saves the user much time However both RStudio and blogdown are opinionated and large If you want to change something then you will either have to do it their way if the option is present or you will have to dig knee deep into code probably for several days to modify things to how you want them This lack of control does not suite me Complete process code For docker images I use one of the following all spark notebook all the data science goodies you expect beakerx strong multi language and prototyping support including JVM languages python and javascript bash create your notebook repo git clone repo bash profile export NOTEBOOK HOME Users jason beach Desktop Projects IMTorgDemo Notebooks create container and share volume docker run d p 8887 8888 v NOTEBOOK HOME home beakerx PROJECTS PERSONAL v WORK HOME home beakerx PROJECTS WORK name cntr beakerx beakerx beakerx Apply consistent formatting across notebooks Using a script to look for such formatting can be helpful The following are useful standards when running the nb2hugo https github com IMTorgCustomSoln nb2hugo script for converting a notebook to markdown notebook name must be lowercase ipynb Title As Above ipynb or part of metadata md All Second Sections to ensure proper smartToc All third sections use opening paragraph beneath metadata ensure either output or markdown cell between code cells reference other posts with absolute url my post ref posts blog page todo md List of Future Posts add external references to documentation ref http domain com add image references description images name png Convert the file to markdown and place files and dependencies into appropriate directory structure bash nb2hugo directory to file ipynb site dir Hugo Site section posts Take a quick look for final review bash hugo server D Then commit and deploy to github pages Also commit and push your notebook modifications to github repo deploy sh add new post This is a simple process once it is set up The only difficulty is getting accustomed to the above formatting rules Jupyter for code and content Jupyter notebooks can be real productivity enhancers because they bring code output and mathematical notation all under one JSON based HTML renderer The notebook can be shared as HTML or converted to other formats While docker is not necessary running Jupyter from docker can make costly installation and configuration changes both automated and portable Two of the best images are all spark notebook https github com jupyter docker stacks tree master all spark notebook all the data science goodies you expect beakerx http beakerx com strong multi language and prototyping support including JVM languages python and javascript The kernels of these two images cover almost every language you might want to use except NodeJs I ve tried a few of different set ups but haven t found any that are consistently maintained Once you ve completed some work in a notebook you have a variety of different formats for which to convert it Converting it to markdown and diseminating files to Hugo is my chosen workflow and the script nb2hugo https github com IMTorgCustomSoln nb2hugo performans quite well by making use of the Jupyter API I m slowly improving it with post processing Hugo for static sites SSGs improved steadily over the last few years and Hugo proclaims it is the fastest for compiling code The speed is quite impressive and allows users to see HTML updates while the underlying markdown is being modified similar to how nodemon https nodemon io works for Node developers Hugo is also relatively simple to learn and customize The basic tutorials https gohugo io documentation are quite good Installing the system with code block language coloring pygments is straightforward brew install hugo pip3 install Pygments pip3 install nb2hugo Typically a new user will get started with a theme chosen from the Hugo Theme library https themes gohugo io The actual theme repo is cloned within the Hugo directory structure hugo new site quickstart cd quickstart git init cd themes git clone depth 1 https github com carsonip hugo theme minos hugo t hugo theme minos The final bit is to customize Hugo using the config toml file This includes adding the url and other static site variables the chosen theme and parameters associated with the theme and static pages like About or Tags Creating a new post from markdown without Jupyter is simply hugo new posts my first post md Hugo has some very powerful themes to choose from including academic https themes gohugo io coder portfolio https themes gohugo io hugo coder portfolio tufte style https github com shawnohare hugo tufte book style https themes gohugo io hugo book Mathematical notation is supported through Katex https katex org docs supported html Useful Tools To deploy Hugo simply place the compiled public directory to a server You have many options however deploying your site simply by pushing commits to your code repo is one of the easiest enter GithubPages https gohugo io hosting and deployment hosting on github The provided Hugo script is quite useful Later you can create a custom domain name and point it at the account github io url such as with Namecheap https www namecheap com support

Lastly you may want to consider distributing your content using other means such as book pdf Pandoc https pandoc org appears to cover all needs for markdown transformations The writer Thorsten Ball https thorstenball com blog 2018 09 04 the tools i use to write books appears to have good experience on this process as well Conclusion There are many choices for distributing content to the web but I find most are time consuming in either overhead process or customization This is not the case with Jupyter and Hugo Overhead is only a few hours for set up and getting accustomed to styling The process only takes a two commands and a localhost review Customization cannot be any easier because of the simplicity of the pipeline and scripts If fewer languages or less flexibility is acceptable than RStudio and blogdown may be preferable but this may be regretful later",

designers so the user can focus on the content It requires a greater technical understanding than typical simple note taking systems however because it is incredibly descriptive and produces aesthetically appealing output it is becoming more popular This post provides a reference to configuration and syntax LaTeX Beginnings Tex is the actual low level language created by Donald Knuth in 1978 Leslie Lamport created an alternative high level macro file called lplain l for Lamport with a set of much easier to use commands The latex script ran the macros first then compiled the Tex language and outputs to a PostScript file that another program converts to a document This evolved into the LaTeX program The LaTeX site https www latex project org provides the open source software distribution that compiles your LaTeX markup Getting this set up and using it can be quite involved and most workflows don t allow for such complexities Also most users don t have to worry about becoming comfortable with the LaTeX markup There are many templates available including free boilerplates http mrzool cc tex boilerplates free templates http www latextemplates com some commercial https www overleaf com gallery tagged book Large journal publications provide their own templates for document preparation such as IEEE http www latextemplates com template ieee However some users may want to customize their own output An example document could include the following begin document begin environment1 begin environment2 end environment2 end environment1 end document There is an interesting post https olivierpieters be blog 2017 02 11 designing a business card in latex describing how to create a business card in LaTeX This is ridiculous For more graphic intensive work there are much better options such Photoshop or even PowerPoint For more information look into latex tutorial https www latex tutorial com Typical Usage Jupyter More commonly simple snippets or blocks of LaTeX are used within common markdown or HTML to display mathematical text or special symbols Pandoc https pandoc org can be used to convert simple markdown into other formats including a PDF file with LaTeX Jupyter notebook uses MathJax https www mathjax org to render LaTeX inside html markdown Just put your LaTeX math inside The inline notation c sqrt a 2 b 2 becomes c sqrt a 2 b 2 The

group A group is either a single symbol or any formula surrounded by curly braces If you do 10 10 you will get a surprise 1010 But 10 10 gives what you probably wanted 10 10 Use curly braces to delimit a formula to which a superscript or subscript applies x 5 6 is an error x y z is x y z x y z is x y z Observe the difference between x i 2 x i 2 and x i 2 x i 2 Parentheses and Ordinary symbols make parentheses and brackets 2 3 4 4 Use and for curly braces These do not scale with the formula in between so if you write frac sqrt x y 3 the parentheses will be too small frac sqrt x y 3 Using left right will make the sizes adjust automatically to the formula they enclose left frac sqrt x y 3 right is left frac sqrt x y 3 right left and right apply to all the following sorts of parentheses vert vert x vert Vert Vert x Vert langle and rangle langle x rangle lceil and rceil lceil x rceil lfloor and rfloor lfloor x rfloor middle can be used to add additional dividers There are also invisible parentheses denoted by left frac12 right rbrace is left frac12 right rbrace If manual size adjustments are required Biggl biggl Bigl bigl x bigr Bigr biggr Biggr gives Biggl biggl Bigl bigl x bigr Bigr biggr Biggr Sums and integrals sum and int the subscript is the lower limit and the superscript is the upper limit so for example sum 1 n sum 1 n Don t forget if the limits are more than a single symbol For example sum i 0 infty i 2 is sum i 0 infty i 2 Similarly prod prod int int bigcup bigcup bigcap bigcap iint iint iiint iiint idotsint idotsint Fractions There are three ways to make these frac ab applies to the next two groups and produces frac ab for more complicated numerators and denominators use frac a 1 b 1 is frac a 1 b 1 If the numerator and denominator are complicated you may prefer over which splits up the group that it is in a 1 over b 1 is a 1 over b 1 Using cfrac a b command is useful for continued fractions cfrac a b more details for which are given in this sub article Radical signs use sqrt which adjusts to the size of its argument sqrt x 3 sqrt x 3 sqrt 3 frac xy sqrt 3 frac xy For complicated expressions consider using 1 2 1 2 instead Special functions such as lim sin max ln and so on are normally set in roman font instead of italic font Use lim lim sin sin etc to make these sin x sin x not sin x sin x Use subscripts to attach a notation to lim lim x to 0 lim x to 0 There are a very large number of special symbols and notations too many to list here see this shorter listing https pic plover com MISC symbols pdf or this

for a wider space a b quad and qquad are large spaces a quad b adn a qquad b To set plain text use text x in s mid x text is extra large You can nest inside of text Accents and diacritical marks use hat for a single symbol hat x widehat for a larger formula hat xy If you make it too wide it will look silly Similarly there are bar bar x and overline overline xyz and vec vec x and overrightarrow

        "content": "\nAfter completing basic high school mathematics one might think that math stands on its own To understand and know that 1 1 2 is obvious But math can go much deeper In fact we can build new concepts from math as well as build a math itself This is important because it effects how we think about other subjects and is especially useful in helping us think about language and abstract concepts such as in programming This post will introduce a few of these concepts We will also make some references to how it is useful in natural language processing Logical Beginnings There are a few different types of logic These are presented here with increasing rigor informal logic typically that of natural language formal logic the study of inference or steps in reasoning in addition it is possible to analyze the form of an argument symbolic logic abstractions for capturing features of inference mathematical logic extension of symbolic to use in different theories such as model set and proof theory Moving from informal to formal logic is a big jump Showing the logical form of an argument is difficult in informal logic because indicative sentences of ordinary language show a considerable variety of form and complexity that makes their use in inference impractical Aristotle was the first to support the use of logical form by defining variables to represent valid inferences An example is all men are mortals has the form all Ps are Qs This advancement leads us to symbolic logic Three formal systems of symbolic logic began with Greek philosophers and now provide the foundations we need to do mathematics These are i syllogism ii propositional sentential and iii predicate first order logics In order to discuss these we need to define a few terms These are formal definitions that are different from how we use every day language but they are not un related Important Definitions Arguments and inference A premise is an assumption that something is true In logic an argument requires a set of at least two declarative sentences known as the premises along with another declarative sentence known as the conclusion The proof of a conclusion depends on both the truth of the premises and the validity of the argument An argument is valid if and only if it takes a form that makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion nevertheless to be false The word inference is used quite often in logic math and statistics It comes from the latin infero which means to carry forward and is usually divided between deduction and induction Deduction is the act of deriving using formal proof logical conclusions from premises using the laws of valid inference So there are a finite sequence of well formed forumlas each of which is an assumption axiom or conclusion inferred from the others used as an assumption that create a theorem proven statement There are a few popular rules for inference and they include such important ones as modus ponens modus tollens contrapositive and reductio ad absurdum for propositional calculus In the example of modus ponens the form is written A B A B There are additional rules for predicate calculus as well as other logics and many of the rules are displayed here https en wikipedia org wiki List of rules of inference A formal system is an organization of terms used for the analysis of deduction It consists of an alphabet a language over the alphabet to construct sentences and a rule for deriving sentences Induction involves inference from particular premises each with some evidence of truth to a universal conclusion While a deductive argument is certain an inductive argument can only be probable It is the basis for the scientific method which is the foundation of all natural sciences study of naturally occurring phenomena Inductive reasoning is inherently uncertain therefore it is important when used for making arguments with probability Bayes rule is an example of a rule for inference within probability based inductive reasoning Instead of being valid or invalid inductive arguments are either strong or weak according to how probable it is that the conclusion is true An argument may be plausible probable reasonable justified or strong but never certain Confusingly inductive reasoning is different from mathematical induction which is a form of deductive reasoning which is used for strict proofs of properties on recursively defined sets Reaching such a deep level of analysis and relating it to the real world can become quite philosophical An example is the Second Axiom of Probability which states that at least one of the elementary events in the entire sample space will occur is 1 which in epistemic uncertainty uses the closed world assumption So it can be difficult to know when one has gone too far down the rabbit hole to use another philosophical reference Oftentimes latin terms may be used to describe rules of inference such as modus ponens and these underly their Greek philosophical underpinnings As an aside the greek language is not used because the vast majority of that culture s ideas are transferred only by the latin bearing Roman scrolls Interestingly there is not much latin texts since the destruction of the Ptolemaic Library of Alexandria also but more is still being uncovered through the use of xray photography that displays text erased to provide for medieval christian writings At the same time some philosophy of science must be understood For instance the idea of hypothesis testing and the use of the p value is fundamental to classical statistics and is almost universally used across all scientific disciplines Less conspicuous but equally controversial is the assumption of ceteris paribus all things held constant in economics research which allowed statistical theory to be bridged from controlled experimental designs to observational data First order logic Syntax is the collection of symbols concepts and rules used for creating well formed expressions It is independent of symantics and interpretation In natural language the rules are called grammar and one such rule in english is that statement structure must be of the form Subject Verb Object Symantics determine the meaning behind expressions It is concerned with words phrases signs and symbols Oftentimes there may be a mapping from one set of symbols to another In effect a translation between known and unknown symbols These necessitate a definition for expression which is a finite combination of symbols that are well formed according to the syntax The term combination can be difficult because mathematical combinations which are selections made regardless of ordering Here order is important to syntax In programming expressions return a new value as opposed to a statement which does not Expressions are stated using terms to represent objects and formulas which are predicates relations to true false A predicate can visualized as the Unit Step Heaviside Function The domain of all terms and formulas symbols is the alphabet of that system Syllogistic and Propositional Logic A syllogism is a kind of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more propositions that are asserted or assumed to be true The modus ponens described above is an example Aristotle of the Nyaya school defined the three part form where from a general statement the major premise and a specific statement the minor premise a conclusion is deduced All men are mortal Socrates is a man Therefore Socrates is mortal The Stoics created propositional logic A proposition is any sentence that can be assigned a truth value such as Helsinki is the capital of Finland The versatility and restriction of propositional logic lies in the fact that we can use it with any statement whatsoever regardless of its inner structure or logical form But it is also very very simple Elementary propositions are denoted usually by letters such as lower case p and q These propositions are connected to each other and manipulated using simple logical connectives such as not and or if then if and only if Using these symbols we can generate combinations of the elementary propositions to claim certain logical connections between them We then use so called truth tables to evaluate the truth of this complex proposition We can also determine whether it is a tautology logical truth In the truth table method we go through all combinations of p and q as to their truth and falsity and see what the truth value of the whole proposition is Like so If the last column has only T in it sometimes or 1 0 are used for truth and falsity the proposition is a tautology if it has only F in it it is a contradiction Predicate and Mathematical Logic While propositional logic treats whole propositions predicate logic distinguishes between objects and their properties called predicates An alphabet consists of logical and non logical symbols Non logical symbols include predicates relations functions and constants The set of all of these are the signature The signature may be i empty ii finite iii infinite or iv uncountable Logical symbols include i quantifiers ii logical connectives iii and truth constants Predicate logic is essentially a system where the elementary propositions of propositional logic can be further analysed using predicates properties that are assigned to subjects For example above Helsinki is the capital of Finland can be further analysed by denoting Helsinki with the lower case letter h and the predicate the capital of Finland with a upper case letter say C We get h is C Predicate logic has standardly employed so called quantifiers which express the scope of the predicate over the subject term In the above case Helsinki is an individual object so a quantifier makes little sense so take the tapir example now the subject term is the general concept of tapir denote it with T and cuddly with C Since the statement in effect claims that all tapirs are cuddly we write All T are C This is the traditional Aristotelian way of expressing the matter But the quantifier itself in modern predicate logic is expressed by one of the two symbols Universal quantifier meaning all every Existential quantifier meaning some there exists Thus we see that unlike propositional logic predicate logic is capable of dealing with sets of entities making it very useful e g in mathematics Unfortunately this property also makes it impossible to employ truth tables in predicate logic one would have to iterate over a potential infinity of individuals Instead in determining the validity of inferences in predicate logic simple logical rules are established and iterated For example we can apply the rule that negating the universal quantifier gives us the existential quantifier with the negation of the proposition x Px x Px Since in addition we can also use all the logical rules established in propositional logic to the propositions themselves we have a very powerful and versatile form of logic Use in Natural Language Processing What does it take to move from a natural language to a logical form First ignoring those grammatical features irrelevant to logic such as gender and declension if the argument is in Latin replacing conjunctions irrelevant to logic such as but with logical conjunctions like and and replacing ambiguous or alternative logical expressions any every etc with expressions of a standard type such as all or the universal quantifier Second certain parts of the sentence must be replaced with schematic letters Thus for example the expression all Ps are Qs shows the logical form common to the sentences all men are mortals all cats are carnivores all Greeks are philosophers and so on The schema can further be condensed into the formula A P Q where the letter A indicates the judgement all are The english language uses the Subject Verb Object statement structure From this a Noun Phrase is created from the subject and object while the verb and object define the predicate The subject and predict together create a clause The clause may be independent or dependent The entire SVO statement in a meaningful context is a sentence Making use of all of these rules and building models around form structure can be highly supportive for both understanding natural language and creating it Conclusion Logic is one of the worlds oldest subjects of study and it is initmately related with mathematics especially at the level of analysis While this may seem impractical for practicioners learning and applying it provides a mucher richer understanding of why and how some things are done in math It also provides a strong precendence in studying math related disciplines such as Natural Language Processing",
