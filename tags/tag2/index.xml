      <title>A Data Scientist&#39;s Guide to Modern Java(8&#43;) and the JVM</title>

      <description>Most data scientists avoid the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) like the plague. The features that make developers and data engineers so productive as a team, such as access modifiers and powerful IDEs, feel slow, old, and cumbersome to individuals interacting with data and prototyping new algorithms. However, the JVM and its supporting system matured to an indominatble force since its inception. It is ubiquitous in the most popular open-source projects; espectially in Big Data and distributed systems, such as Hadoop and Kafka.</description>

      <title>The Linux Command Line with Fish Shell</title>

      <description>The Linux terminal (typically implemented with the Bourne Again Shell Script, BASH) can be intimidating for beginners and annoying for experienced programmers. But, it is a necessity for most users of Linux; and, in many situations, it can also be a huge productivity enhancer over graphical interfaces.
Fish is a commandline tool that is a great complement to BASH. It is highly configureable and provides nice features such as syntax coloring and TAB command completion, out-of-the-box.</description>

      <title>Simple, Scalable, and Responsive Data Retrieval with ElasticSearch</title>
      <link>https://imtorgdemo.github.io/posts/blog_datastore-elasticsearch/</link>

      <description>Distributed systems are very popular tools in the &amp;lsquo;big data&amp;rsquo; market space and ElasticSearch evolved to become one of the major players. It serves the niche role of scaling to store large amounts of data, then allows querying it quickly. It evolved greatly over the last ten years to provide a variety of functionality. While it serves its primary purpose well, teams should resist the urge to use it in other roles, such as advanced analytics.</description>
