      <description>I thought about why I felt like some data scientists are more Junior- to Mid- level data scientists; rather than Mid- to Senior- level. The reason I think this is because I often ask them to propose some type of design for a solution to multiple requirements / problems. The response is almost always &amp;lsquo;how do I do this?&amp;rsquo; - bad answer. This is very different from high-performing teams I&amp;rsquo;ve been on where it is more common to have multiple people arguing over multiple solution designs.</description>
