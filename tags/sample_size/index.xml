      <description>Consider that we are creating a text classification model that will discover a few target needles in a massive haystack of records. Maybe we are looking for messages of Death among emergency services messages - 20 for every 50,000 messages. Labeling this large dataset and finding the Death messages is costly, so we don&amp;rsquo;t want to label more than is necessary. If we already have enough to estimate the target proportion, let us determine whether the sample size used for training the classification model is large enough.</description>

      <description>We are going to dive into the deep disturbing world of sample size in AI. This work is RARELY done as part of AI solutions. There are comparatively few research papers on this topic, and the approaches they offer tend to be specific to the underlying problem addressed in the paper. However, the simple fact that it is poorly understood gives great understanding to the world of AI, which is why I describe it as &amp;lsquo;disturbing&amp;rsquo;.</description>
