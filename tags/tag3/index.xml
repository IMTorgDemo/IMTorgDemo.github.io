      <description>After completing basic high school mathematics, one might think that math stands on its own. To understand and know that 1+1=2 is obvious. But math can go much deeper. In fact, we can build new concepts from math as well as build a math, itself. This is important because it effects how we think about other subjects, and is especially useful in helping us think about language and abstract concepts, such as in programming.</description>

      <description>Static Site Generators are quite popular replacements for traditional server-based methods of delivering HTML. One of the most popular is Hugo because of its compilation speed. Combining Hugo with Jupyter notebooks, and other tools, can provide for a speedy workflow for pushing your ideas to the web, books (online or pdf), and more. This post will discuss why you may want to do this and provides tools for doing it.</description>

      <description>LaTeX is the document preparation and typesetting system used for scientific publications. LaTeX is based on the idea that &amp;lsquo;it is better to leave document design to document designers&amp;rsquo;, so the user can focus on the content. It requires a greater technical understanding than typical simple note-taking systems; however, because it is incredibly descriptive and produces aesthetically-appealing output, it is becoming more popular. This post provides a reference to configuration and syntax.</description>

      <title>A Data Scientist&#39;s Guide to Modern Java(8&#43;) and the JVM</title>

      <description>Most data scientists avoid the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) like the plague. The features that make developers and data engineers so productive as a team, such as access modifiers and powerful IDEs, feel slow, old, and cumbersome to individuals interacting with data and prototyping new algorithms. However, the JVM and its supporting system matured to an indominatble force since its inception. It is ubiquitous in the most popular open-source projects; espectially in Big Data and distributed systems, such as Hadoop and Kafka.</description>

      <title>The Linux Command Line with Fish Shell</title>

      <description>The Linux terminal (typically implemented with the Bourne Again Shell Script, BASH) can be intimidating for beginners and annoying for experienced programmers. But, it is a necessity for most users of Linux; and, in many situations, it can also be a huge productivity enhancer over graphical interfaces.
Fish is a commandline tool that is a great complement to BASH. It is highly configureable and provides nice features such as syntax coloring and TAB command completion, out-of-the-box.</description>
