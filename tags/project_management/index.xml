      <description>Powerpoint is becoming a de-facto form of communication both within and between organizations. This has both pros and cons, but the important thing to emphasize, when you can, is that it is just a tool. As soon as slides become a sacred cow, then you&amp;rsquo;re no longer delivering value. You&amp;rsquo;re just pushing propaganda.
Commercial
can be a useful tool provide talking points a way to start a discussion with the customer leads to key concepts that customer should take away fewer presentations, but similar pitch, supports personal engagement will definitely have a few important numbers, that will be discussed not the place to make promises / commits; that is during contract negotiation and final delivery Government</description>

      <description>Agile is used to remove uncertainty from projects, so that the features for development are fairly clear, at least for the current iteration. However, producing an analytics application creates many more tasks because it is focused on data. To remove uncertainty from these data tasks, and the overall project, we keep it separate from development. This ensures that we: i) understand the data, ii) have a clear methodology for addressing problems using the data.</description>

      <description>A colleague of mine has put-off using Slack for a while. She&amp;rsquo;s totally committed to Skype for Business, which I&amp;rsquo;m a little revolted by. When I described Slack to her, &amp;lsquo;Instead of separate conversations, you have a continuing discussion or narrative with people. You often end using it as a Knowledge Base&amp;rsquo;. Her response to that, &amp;lsquo;so I can&amp;rsquo;t use it for the things that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t go in writing &amp;ndash; got it.</description>

      <description>Comparing offers between the federal government and private sector can be very difficult. It is more akin to choosing between an academic career than it is a choice with another commercial employer. Because of the benefits the government offers, it is very much an apples and oranges comparison.
Here are three huge benefits of working with the government:
Retirement - occaisionally, some very large, older firms (insurance or banking) will have a pension system.</description>

      <title>Difficulties in Working with Contractor Teams on Data Science Projects</title>
      <link>https://imtorgdemo.github.io/posts/blog_pm-tech_contractors/</link>

      <description>Working with contractors can be very helpful in some situations. There is an understanding of support without long-term commitment. However, giving too much control to contractors can be very dangerous because their incentives are often quite different from yours.
This is especially true in Data Science projects because of the long-term investments that must be made. There are several areas of caution which should be addressed to ensure the project is kept under control.</description>

      <description>You built it, it works, but you&amp;rsquo;re far from monetization or even consistent users. So, how do you proceed? Below is a list of questions to ask yourself.
Did you solve the problem for which you originally targeted? Is the original problem that you intended to solve still important? Oftentimes, you may need to decompose the problem in greater detail: What aspects of the problem are users most concerned? The greater problem depth will lend to 2-3 detailed solution methodologies: How (by what criteria) should we best solve it?</description>
