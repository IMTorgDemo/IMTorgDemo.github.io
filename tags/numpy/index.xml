      <description>Numpy and Pandas are the basic data science tools in the Python environment. Having a good understanding of their capabilities and how they process data is imperative to writing optimal code. This post provides an introductory overview and a refresher for those who might come back to the libraries after taking a break. The end of the post explains external interfaces for increasing code execution and performing more sophisticated matrix operations.</description>

      <description>The Artificial Intelligence field is moving from single-function libraries to frameworks for building different network models. TensorFlow was one of the first, and has strong production capabilities, such as process optimizations. However, its syntax is unintuitive, and the library has a reputation for being difficult for testing new models. This led to many organizations adopting PyTorch, with underlying Numpy, for designing network models. This post describes the basic data structures for working with Matrices and Tensors in PyTorch.</description>
