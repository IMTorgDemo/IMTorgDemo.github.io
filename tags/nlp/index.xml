      <description>After completing basic high school mathematics, one might think that math stands on its own. To understand and know that 1+1=2 is obvious. But math can go much deeper. In fact, we can build new concepts from math as well as build a math, itself. This is important because it effects how we think about other subjects, and is especially useful in helping us think about language and abstract concepts, such as in programming.</description>

      <title>Solving Textual Problems with Regular Expressions</title>

      <description>Regular Expressions provide an important foundation for learning systems. They are useful for quick and direct approaches to solving problems without creating mounds of training data, nor the infrastructure for deploying a model. While they are a common programming technique, and simple enough to employ, they tend to be used so infrequently that you must re-learn them each time you wish to apply. This post summarizes the basic regex syntax, strategies, and workflow in hopes it will decrease the time needed to implement.</description>
