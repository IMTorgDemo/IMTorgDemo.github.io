      <description>Numpy and Pandas are the basic data science tools in the Python environment. Having a good understanding of their capabilities and how they process data is imperative to writing optimal code. This post provides an introductory overview and a refresher for those who might come back to the libraries after taking a break. The end of the post explains external interfaces for increasing code execution and performing more sophisticated matrix operations.</description>

      <description>Although Pandas uses the Dataframe as its primary data structure, just as R does, the Pandas syntax and underlying fundamentals can be disorienting for R users. This post will describe some basic comparisons and inconsistencies between the two languages. It will also provide some examples of very non-intuitive solutions to common problems.
Introduction In the Datascience R versus Pandas debate, it is really an apples and oranges comparison. R is a domain specific language in the field of statistics, analytics, and data visualization.</description>
