      <title>Python Functional Programming</title>

      <description>Introduction Most programming languages are procedural or are written in an imperative style: programs are lists of instructions that tell the computer what to do with the program’s input. Even &amp;lsquo;purely&amp;rsquo; OOP languages, such as Java, are typically written in an imperative style with little thought give in actual OOP modeling.
Functional code is characterised by one thing: the absence of side effects. It doesn’t rely on data outside the current function, and it doesn’t change data that exists outside the current function.</description>

      <title>Object Oriented Programming with Python</title>

      <description>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) programming became popular with Java. Microsoft quickly followed-up with the C# language. Now, OOP concepts are available in many languages. Python inherits alot of these OOP attributes, but performs it in its usual pythonic minimalism. The concepts are the same, but much of the cruft, such as accessor modifiers, are limited, leaving an succinct and enjoyable object modeling experience.
Introduction OOP deals with classes (blueprints) and objects (instances of blueprint).</description>

      <title>The R and Pandas Dataframe</title>
      <link>https://imtorgdemo.github.io/posts/blog_ds-dataframe_r_and_pandas/</link>

      <description>Although Pandas uses the Dataframe as its primary data structure, just as R does, the Pandas syntax and underlying fundamentals can be disorienting for R users. This post will describe some basic comparisons and inconsistencies between the two languages. It will also provide some examples of very non-intuitive solutions to common problems.
Introduction In the Datascience R versus Pandas debate, it is really an apples and oranges comparison. R is a domain specific language in the field of statistics, analytics, and data visualization.</description>

      <title>Working through a Progressive Python Application</title>

      <description>This post walks the developer through a python application as it progresses in development. It uses linux, docker, vscode, pyenv, pipenv and other tools for developing, building, and deploying an application.
Environment Two tools can help you setup your local development environment: pyenv and pipenv. Pyenv is good for getting the correct python version. Pipenv is quite good at setting your virtual environment so that your versions of python and dependencies are separate from your actual machine.</description>
