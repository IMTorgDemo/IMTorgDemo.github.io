      <title>Introduction to Groovy for Data Science on the JVM</title>

      <description>Groovy is a scripting language that compiles to the Java Virtual Machine. It would be more-aptly named JavaScript if that name were not already taken, but it has many similarities to Python. In fact, some of the libraries implemented for Groovy, such as TableSaw, attempt to take it in the same Data Science direction as Python.
This post will provide an introduction to the Groovy language using Jupyter notebook with BeakerX, and provides specific applications to Data Science.</description>

      <title>Solving Textual Problems with Regular Expressions</title>

      <description>Regular Expressions provide an important foundation for learning systems. They are useful for quick and direct approaches to solving problems without creating mounds of training data, nor the infrastructure for deploying a model. While they are a common programming technique, and simple enough to employ, they tend to be used so infrequently that you must re-learn them each time you wish to apply. This post summarizes the basic regex syntax, strategies, and workflow in hopes it will decrease the time needed to implement.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Machine Learning Process</title>
      <link>https://imtorgdemo.github.io/posts/blog_models-machine_learning/</link>

      <description>This work describes a general approach to follow when performing machine learning (ML) manually, and when automating in a deployment setting. Unlike a classical statistical analysis, standard machine learning projects typically follow a general and repeatable process. While the practictioner should be aware of details for each of the steps and the reasons for choosing them, there is much less design-thinking and checking of assumptions that are necessary components of more mathematical modeling fields.</description>
