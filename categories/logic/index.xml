      <description>After completing basic high school mathematics, one might think that math stands on its own. To understand and know that 1+1=2 is obvious. But math can go much deeper. In fact, we can build new concepts from math as well as build a math, itself. This is important because it effects how we think about other subjects, and is especially useful in helping us think about language and abstract concepts, such as in programming.</description>

      <description>LaTeX is the document preparation and typesetting system used for scientific publications. LaTeX is based on the idea that &amp;lsquo;it is better to leave document design to document designers&amp;rsquo;, so the user can focus on the content. It requires a greater technical understanding than typical simple note-taking systems; however, because it is incredibly descriptive and produces aesthetically-appealing output, it is becoming more popular. This post provides a reference to configuration and syntax.</description>
