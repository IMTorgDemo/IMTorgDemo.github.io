      <description>I recently implemented search functionality for my Hugo site, which can be seen at: https://imtorgdemo.github.io/pages/search/. The search uses lunr.js, an implementation of Solr. While it works, sufficiently, the metadata used for ranking queries could be improved. It would also be nice to visually locate the results by where resulting posts fit into the three data science fundamental disciplines: mathematics, computer science, and business. This narrative provides a quick solution for ranking posts by each discipline, then reducing the dimensions to 3 axes in the xy-plane.</description>

      <description>After completing basic high school mathematics, one might think that math stands on its own. To understand and know that 1+1=2 is obvious. But math can go much deeper. In fact, we can build new concepts from math as well as build a math, itself. This is important because it effects how we think about other subjects, and is especially useful in helping us think about language and abstract concepts, such as in programming.</description>

      <title>Introduction to LaTeX</title>

      <description>LaTeX is the document preparation and typesetting system used for scientific publications. LaTeX is based on the idea that &amp;lsquo;it is better to leave document design to document designers&amp;rsquo;, so the user can focus on the content. It requires a greater technical understanding than typical simple note-taking systems; however, because it is incredibly descriptive and produces aesthetically-appealing output, it is becoming more popular. This post provides a reference to configuration and syntax.</description>
